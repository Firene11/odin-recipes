        saucy mix over waffles, crepes, or French toast!"</i></h2></p>

    <p><h4>Bananas Foster is an old-school dessert that looks and tastes significantly 
        more complicated than it is, making it an ideal meal-ender when you’re strapped 
        for time but still want to show off. With a few tablespoons of rum contained in a skillet (off the heat) and a 
         long-reach lighter or long match to keep you away from the flames, you’ll get 
         all of the wow factor and flavor with none of the danger.</p></h4>
         
         <h4><p>Slightly underripe 
         bananas work well here, as they soften nicely in the caramel sauce but maintain
          their shape while cooking. While the toasted pecans aren’t traditional, they
           add delightful crunch.</h4></p>

<b>INGREDIENTS:</b>
<ul>
    <li>3 Tbsp pecans</li>
    <li>4 Tbsp unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
    <li>¼ cup (packed; 50 g) dark brown sugar</li>
    <li>½ tsp ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>¼ tsp ground cardamom</li>
    <li>½ tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 bananas, halved lengthwise, then crosswise</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>3 Tbsp. dark rum (80-100 proof)</li>
    <li>Vanilla ice cream (for serving)</li>
</ul>
<br>

<b>STEPS:</b>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat oven to 325°. Toast 3 Tbsp. pecans on a small rimmed baking sheet,
             tossing halfway through, until slightly darkened in color and fragrant, 
             10-12 minutes. Let cool, then coarsely chop.</p></li>

        <li><p>Heat 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces, ¼ cup (packed; 50 g) 
            dark brown sugar, ½ tsp. ground cinnamon, and ¼ tsp. ground cardamom in a 
            medium skillet over medium-high, whisking constantly as the mixture bubbles, 
            until butter is melted and incorporated, about 1 minute. Add ½ tsp. 
            vanilla extract and cook sauce, continuing to whisk, until slightly 
            thickened, about 30 seconds.</p></li>

        <li><p>Arrange 2 bananas, halved lengthwise, then crosswise, cut side down,
             in pan and cook, shaking pan occasionally, until lightly browned, 30-60 
             seconds. Using tongs or a small spatula, turn bananas over and sprinkle 
             cut sides with kosher salt. Cook, shaking pan occasionally, until bananas 
             are browned and coated in sauce, 30-60 seconds. Remove from heat.</p></li>

        <li><p>Drizzle 3 Tbsp. dark rum (80-100 proof) over bananas and sauce. Using 
            lighter, carefully ignite sauce and flambé, shaking pan occasionally, 
            until flame goes out.</p></li>

        <li><p>Top with scoops of vanilla ice cream and scatter pecans over.</p></li>
    </ol>
